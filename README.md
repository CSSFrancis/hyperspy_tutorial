# 2020 CCEM Image Processing Workshop Tutorial:

This repository contains the files needed for the HyperSpy tutorial session 
presented at the virtual CCEM Image Processing Workshop on May 1, 2020.
The content is structured by topic, with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
Notebooks in each folder containing the workshop materials. We recommend
following along in the *non*-completed notebook file, and leaving the notebook
marked `_completed` as a reference (an "answer key") that contains the expected
outputs of each command.

For additional information, please visit the 
[website](https://pages.nist.gov/hyperspy_tutorial) set up for the
tutorial.
