2019 NIST HyperSpy Tutorial
===========================

About the session
+++++++++++++++++

Thank you for registering for the NIST ODI-MMSD tutorial session on HyperSpy!
This informal tutorial session will introduce you to the capabilities of
HyperSpy in a casual and interactive environment, with plenty of time allocated
for questions and individual help. The goal for the session is that by the end
each attendee feels comfortable using HyperSpy for basic hyperspectral data
analysis, and knows where to look for further help, if necessary.

    | |josh|  | | **Josh Taillon** is a research engineer within the Office     |
    |         |   of Data and Informatics (MML), and has an extensive           |
    |         |   background in materials science, microscopy, and data analysis|
    |         |   utilizingÂ machine learning, artificial intelligence, and      |
    |         |   state-of-the art signal processing techniques to facilitate   |
    |         |   greater understanding of material systems. He is a (fairly)   |
    |         |   regular contributor to the upstream HyperSpy project and has  |
    |         |   been a user of the software for over 5 years.                 |

    | |andy|  | | **Andy Herzing** is a staff scientist in the Materials        |
    |         |   Structure and Data Group of the Materials Measurement Science |
    |         |   Division (MML) and is an expert in the quantitative structural|
    |         |   and chemical characterization of small volumes of material    |
    |         |   using electron microscopy techniques. He has used (and        |
    |         |   extended) HyperSpy to enable reproducible and well-documented |
    |         |   data  analysis for objectively processing chemical tomography |
    |         |   data based on hyperspectral images in the TEM.                |

Pre-tutorial instructions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please review this section in advance of Friday's tutorial session, as it
includes instructions for installing HyperSpy and the Jupyter interactive
computing environment.

.. admonition:: Installation alternatives

    While we encourage everyone to follow the instruction below to install
    HyperSpy locally on their personal system, we will also provide a web-based
    `JupyterHub`_ instance that can be used through a normal web browser,
    without installing anything to your system. If you choose to use this
    option, all you will need is a computer with a modern web browser (even a
    tablet with external keyboard should work).
